TODO: URL TO BLOG POST

In this tutorial, I will show you, how you can upgrade from Sencha Touch 2 to Ext JS 6 modern, 
and why you should consider to make this step.

I used for this tutorial my old tutorial files, for the “Do I need my umbrella” weather application, 
I wrote this tutorial a couple of years ago with Sencha Touch 2. 
You can find the original tutorial here: https://www.sencha.com/blog/getting-started-with-sencha-touch-2-build-a-weather-utility-app-part-1/
